def route_query_to_agent(query: str, company, user_email):
    """Routes the user query to the appropriate AI agent."""
    # This is a simplified routing logic.
    # In a real application, this would involve more sophisticated NLP and AI.

    # Example: Check if the query can be answered by the FAQ agent using RAG
    # You would implement the RAG logic here or call a function that does it.
    # For now, let's simulate a response or trigger ticket creation.

    # Placeholder logic:
    if "FAQ" in query.upper() or "frequently asked questions" in query.lower():
        # In a real scenario, call the FAQ agent and use RAG
        faq_agent = FAQAgent(company)
        response = faq_agent.handle_query(query)
        if response:
            return response
        # return "This is a simulated response from the FAQ agent."

    elif "troubleshoot" in query.lower() or "fix" in query.lower():
        # In a real scenario, call the Troubleshooting agent
        # troubleshooting_agent = TroubleshootingAgent(company)
        # response = troubleshooting_agent.handle_query(query)
        # if response:
        #     return response
         return "This is a simulated response from the Troubleshooting agent."

    # If no specific agent can handle the query, trigger ticket creation
    else:
        # In a real scenario, call the Ticket Creation agent
        # ticket_creation_agent = TicketCreationAgent(company)
        # ticket_details = ticket_creation_agent.extract_ticket_details(query)

        # Create the ticket using the backend API
        # For MVP, subject can be the first part of the query or a default
        subject = query[:100] if len(query) > 100 else query
        ticket = Ticket.objects.create(
            company=company,
            user_email=user_email,
            subject=f"Support Request: {subject}",
            description=query,
            assigned_to=None  # Assign to None initially, indicating it's unassigned
        )
        # Assign to a human agent (this is a conceptual step)
        # In a real system, you might have an 'assigned_to' field on the Ticket model
        # and assign it to a default human agent or queue here.
        print(f"Ticket created: {ticket.id} for {user_email} at {company.name}. Needs human agent attention.")

        return ticket # Return the created ticket object

    # Note: You would need to implement the actual AI agents (FAQAgent, etc.)
    # and their logic for interacting with the knowledge base and potentially creating tickets.
